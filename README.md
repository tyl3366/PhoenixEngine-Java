# PhoenixEngine-Java

Chess engine in Java that I have been coding for a bit. Mostly have been following the series of tutorials by Logic Crazy Chess.

Eventually I will probably rewrite this as my own. It will just be a Java version of my Phoenix Engine in Python. Maybe I will eventually remake it in C++
For now I will mostly be working on my Python version.
